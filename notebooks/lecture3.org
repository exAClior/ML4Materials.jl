#+TITLE: Multi-scale Modeling

* Modeling
- Different scale: QM -> MD -> Kinetic Theory -> Continuum Mechanics

** Two regimes
- Sequential coupling: compute the macro scale model from micro
- Concurrent coupling: coupling micro scale model with macro and compute on the fly

** Sequential Learning
- Collect data, label them and then train

** Concurrent Learning
- Generate data on the fly

** Active Learning
- unlabeled data, like unsupervised learning


** Deep Learning to help MD
- Preserving symmetry helps speed up MD simulation with DL
  1) E.g: translational and rotational symmetry
  2) Permutational symmetry, but there might be discontinuity on PES

** To solve Boltzman Equation
- Use Moment Method
