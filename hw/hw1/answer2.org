* Answer 2
In this problem, I will investigate the influence of number of epochs a two
layer neural is trained on the accuracy of the model. I investigate for five different types of functions.

** Smooth vs Non-smooth function
For the smooth function, I use the function $f(x) = x$, and for the
non-smooth function, I use the function $f(x) = x - \lfloor x \rfloor$.

As indicated in the graph below, the non-smooth is more difficult to train than
the smooth function. I.e, it reaches low loss in later epochs. The accuracy of
the model for the non-smooth function also starts out to be worse than that of
the smooth function.
